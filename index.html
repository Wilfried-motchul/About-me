                My name is Will, and I was born Cameroon, a country located in Central Africa. I moved to the United States 5 years ago, to pursue a career in Computer Science. I just obtained my assiciate in Computer Science from Shoreline Community College, and I am currently a New Technologist Intern at Microsoft. My current goal is to become a developer and leverage my skills in a Tech Company, to by able to participate in the making of new technologies. I also hope to be able to work with people from Africa to build a community of developers and insire the young generation to pursue a career in technology!
